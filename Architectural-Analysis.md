# Architectural Analysis

## What is it?
**Architectural Analysis** is the process of evaluating software architectures to ensure they meet business and technical requirements. Various methodologies exist to analyze trade-offs, assess risks, and determine how well the system meets its quality attributes.

## Common Architectural Analysis Techniques
- **ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method):** Evaluates trade-offs between different quality attributes to understand the impact of architectural decisions.
- **Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW):** Defines and prioritizes quality attributes with stakeholders before architectural decisions are made.
- **Risk-Driven Analysis:** Identifies and evaluates architectural risks early in the design process.
- **Scenario-Based Analysis:** Uses real-world scenarios to assess how the architecture responds to expected and unexpected conditions.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM):** Assesses architecture changes based on cost and expected benefits to guide decision-making.

## Structured Architectural Analysis Process
Once a technique is chosen, the analysis typically follows these steps:

### **Step 1: Analysis of Architectural Approaches**
- Define key **architectural decisions** and **quality attributes** to be analyzed.
- Identify relevant trade-offs that impact the system.

### **Step 2: Scenarios**
- Establish the scenarios to be evaluated based on the chosen analysis technique.
- For **ATAM**, define stimulus-response quality attribute scenarios.
- For **Scenario-Based Analysis**, outline real-world use cases.

### **Step 3: Evaluation Evidence**
- Collect evidence (textual and/or visual) demonstrating how the application meets the defined scenarios.
- This might include architectural diagrams, performance benchmarks, security test results, or risk assessment reports.

### **Step 4: Critical Evaluation of Results**
- Reflect on **lessons learned, challenges encountered, and trade-offs**.
- Compare the results with intended quality attributes to see what was achieved and what wasnâ€™t.
- Identify potential improvements or risks.

### **Step 5: Conclusion**
- Summarize key findings and decisions made.
- Identify future improvements or additional evaluations that may be required.

## ATAM Example

### Step 1: Analysis of Architectural Approaches

**Analysis of Architectural Approaches:** This section structures the application's evaluation using the ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method).

| Quality Attributes | Scenarios | Importance | Complexity |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Performance        |           |            |            |
| Usability          |           |            |            |
| Reliability        |           |            |            |
| ...                |           |            |            |

### Step 2: Scenarios

**Scenarios:** Establish the scenarios to be evaluated as per the ATAM method.

### Step 3: Evaluation Evidence

- **Evaluation Evidence:** Present evidence (textual and/or visual) demonstrating how the application meets the scenarios under evaluation based on the ATAM method.

### Step 4: Critical Evaluation of Results

- **Critical Evaluation of Results:** Provide a critical assessment, reflecting on lessons learned, challenges encountered, and the pros and cons. Compare the outcomes with the intended goals to assess what was achieved and what was not, in terms of objectives.

### Step 5: Conclusion

- **Conclusion:** Write a conclusion that wraps up the work while leaving possibilities open for its future continuation.
