# Trigger List for Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

> [System Modeling](README.md)

## Performance and Scalability
- Maximum response time for key operations.
- Maximum acceptable load (e.g., concurrent users, transactions per second).
- Data throughput (e.g., bandwidth, I/O requirements).
- Scalability (horizontal/vertical scaling capabilities).
- Peak usage scenarios and system behavior.

## Availability and Reliability
- Required uptime percentage (e.g., 99.9% SLA).
- Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
- Handling of planned maintenance and outages.
- Failover mechanisms and disaster recovery plans.

## Security
- Authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, MFA).
- Authorization rules and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Encryption (at-rest, in-transit).
- Security standards compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001).
- Vulnerability management and patching.

## Usability and Accessibility
- Supported devices, screen sizes, and browsers.
- Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
- User interface (UI) response feedback time.
- Multilingual or localization requirements.
- Onboarding or help/documentation requirements.

## Maintainability and Supportability
- Code maintainability (e.g., modular design, coding standards).
- Logging and monitoring (e.g., structured logs, APM tools).
- Debugging and diagnostic tools.
- Upgrade/downgrade simplicity.
- Dependency version control and compatibility.

## Interoperability and Integration
- Supported protocols and data exchange formats (e.g., REST, GraphQL, SOAP).
- Third-party APIs, tools, or services integrations.
- Legacy systems compatibility.
- Cross-platform operability.

## Compliance and Regulatory
- Industry-specific compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, SOX).
- Data retention and deletion policies.
- Licensing or intellectual property restrictions.
- Audit trail and traceability requirements.

## Data Management
- Data storage and backup requirements.
- Data consistency, accuracy, and integrity.
- Data archiving and purging rules.
- Data migration needs from legacy systems.

## Portability
- Supported deployment environments (e.g., cloud, on-premise, hybrid).
- Containerization and orchestration requirements (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- Platform independence.

## Testability
- Automated testing requirements (e.g., unit, integration, regression).
- Test data setup and management.
- Mocking and simulation needs for external systems.

## Efficiency
- Resource consumption (e.g., CPU, memory, storage usage).
- Energy efficiency requirements for green computing.

## Auditing and Reporting
- Audit log requirements (e.g., actions, timestamps, user IDs).
- Analytics and reporting tools.
- Report customization and export capabilities.

## Localization and Internationalization
- Language support.
- Region-specific customizations (e.g., date, currency formats).
- Timezone management.

## Resilience and Fault Tolerance
- Graceful degradation on partial system failure.
- Redundancy and fault-tolerant architecture.
- Error recovery mechanisms.

## Extensibility and Modularity
- Plug-in or add-on support.
- Future enhancement flexibility.
- API or SDK availability for customization
