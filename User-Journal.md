# User Journey
## What is it?
A **User Journey** describes the end-to-end experience of a user interacting with the system. It helps visualize the flow of actions users take to achieve their goals, highlighting pain points, key interactions, and moments of delight.

## How to Define It?
1. **Identify the User Persona** – Define who the user is and their main objectives.
2. **Map the Steps** – List the sequential steps the user follows to complete a task.
3. **Define Touchpoints** – Identify where the user interacts with the system (UI, API, notifications, etc.).
4. **Consider Edge Cases** – Think about alternative paths, errors, or friction points in the journey.
5. **Visualize the Journey** – Use diagrams like **flowcharts**, **storyboards**, or **swimlane diagrams**.

## Example
For an **online booking system**, a user journey for booking a service might be:
1. **Discovery** – The user searches for a service provider.
2. **Selection** – The user filters and selects a provider based on reviews and pricing.
3. **Booking** – The user schedules an appointment.
4. **Payment** – The user completes payment.
5. **Confirmation** – The system sends a confirmation email/SMS.
6. **Service Execution** – The user receives the service.
7. **Feedback** – The system requests a review.
