# Trigger Lists for Analysis, Design, and Implementation

> [System Modeling](README.md)

## **1. Analysis**
Identify general aspects that make up the software architecture:

- **Persistence**  
  - What data needs to be stored?  
  - How will data retrieval and storage be optimized?  
  - Are relational or non-relational databases required?  
  - Is caching necessary for performance?  

- **Integration**  
  - Are there legacy systems that need to be integrated?  
  - What APIs or middleware will facilitate this integration?  
  - What protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC, SOAP) are appropriate?  

- **Logging**  
  - What events or actions need to be logged?  
  - Are audit trails required for compliance?  
  - How will log data be aggregated and analyzed?  

- **Front-End Environment**  
  - Which frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) are suitable for the UI?  
  - Is server-side rendering required?  
  - What are the UI/UX requirements?  

- **Exception Handling**  
  - What types of failures should the system handle?  
  - How will errors be logged and reported?  
  - Are custom error pages or recovery mechanisms required?  

- **Testing Format**  
  - What types of tests are necessary (unit, integration, end-to-end)?  
  - Will test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD) be used?  
  - What coverage is required for test scenarios?  

- **Deployment Format**  
  - Will the solution be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid?  
  - What CI/CD pipelines need to be established?  
  - How will versioning and rollbacks be handled?

## **2. Design**
Define the technological patterns to follow for each mechanism identified in **Analysis**:

- **Persistence**  
  - Use of Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling for relational data.  
  - Adoption of document or key-value stores for non-relational data.  
  - Data partitioning and sharding strategies.  

- **Integration**  
  - Design patterns like Adapter, Fa√ßade, or Bridge for legacy system compatibility.  
  - API gateways or message queues for asynchronous communication.  
  - Use of integration platforms (e.g., Apache Camel, MuleSoft).  

- **Logging**  
  - Centralized logging patterns (e.g., ELK stack).  
  - Implementation of structured logs (e.g., JSON format).  
  - Use of log rotation or retention policies.  

- **Front-End Environment**  
  - Component-based design for reusable UI elements.  
  - State management solutions (e.g., Redux, Vuex).  
  - Mobile-first or responsive design frameworks.  

- **Exception Handling**  
  - Implementation of a global error handler.  
  - Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance.  
  - Categorization of recoverable vs. unrecoverable errors.  

- **Testing Format**  
  - Design of test cases with clear boundaries and acceptance criteria.  
  - Automation frameworks for continuous testing.  
  - Mocking and stubbing strategies for isolated tests.  

- **Deployment Format**  
  - Blue/green deployment or canary release patterns.  
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.  
  - Containerization and orchestration strategies (e.g., Kubernetes).
