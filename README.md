# System Modeling

## 1. Introduction

### Context

### Problems Statements

### Objectives | Expectations | Goals

## Business Model

## 2. Personas

## 3. User Journeys

### Workflow Template

| **Workflow Step**     | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Action Trigger**     | Define what initiates the journey (e.g., "User searches for a service").        |
| **System Response**    | Describe how the system responds at each step.                                  |
| **User Interaction**   | Detail what the user does next.                                                 |
| **Alternative Paths**  | Account for error cases, incomplete data, or unusual conditions.                |
| **End State**          | Define the completion point of the workflow.                                    |


## 4. Requirements

1. **Analyze Business Goals**
   - Review business objectives and strategic goals
   - Identify key business priorities and constraints

2. **Review Quality Attributes**
   - Examine FURPS+ quality attributes
   - Prioritize critical non-functional requirements
   - Consider performance, security, scalability, etc.

3. **Evaluate Technical Constraints**
   - Identify technology limitations
   - Consider infrastructure constraints
   - Review integration requirements

4. **Assess Stakeholder Concerns**
   - Gather input from key stakeholders
   - Document critical concerns and requirements
   - Understand risk tolerance levels

5. **Prioritize Drivers**
   - Rank drivers based on importance
   - Consider dependencies between drivers
   - Document rationale for prioritization

Key Outputs:
- List of primary architectural drivers
- Prioritization matrix
- Impact analysis on system architecture

### Constraints

### Functional Requirements | Functionalities

**F**URPS+

### Non-functional Requirements | Quality Attributes

F**URPS+**

### [Architectural Mechanisms](Architectural-Mechanisms.md)

## 5. System Architecture

To identify appropriate architectural styles for the system, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Quality Attribute Requirements**
   - Review key quality attributes identified earlier
   - Map requirements to architectural patterns
   - Consider tradeoffs between different styles

2. **Evaluate System Context**
   - Assess deployment environment
   - Consider integration requirements
   - Review system scale and complexity

3. **Consider Common Architectural Styles**
   - Layered Architecture
   - Microservices Architecture 
   - Event-Driven Architecture
   - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
   - Pipeline Architecture
   - Model-View-Controller (MVC)

4. **Assess Pattern Combinations**
   - Identify complementary patterns
   - Consider hybrid approaches
   - Evaluate pattern integration points

5. **Document Style Selection**
   - Justify architectural choices
   - Map styles to requirements
   - Document known limitations
   - Outline mitigation strategies

Key Outputs:
- Selected architectural style(s)
- Pattern combination analysis
- Architectural decisions record
- Style-to-requirement mapping

### System Context

### System Containers

### System Components

### System Interfaces

### System Data

### Dynamic View

### Deployment View

## Architectural Analysis

### Step 1: Create a Utility Tree

To create a utility tree for architectural analysis

### Step 4: Document Initial ADRs

Document initial Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Step 5: Conduct an ATAM Session

Conduct an Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)
